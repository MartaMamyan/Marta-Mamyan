#Here we see that the visits from Asia for these 2 categories are heteroscedastic, so there is no specific linear relationship
#Nonetheless, the visitors from the US for visiting the relatives and just for pleasure are a bit lineary correlated
#This means that if in a month there were more visits to relatives, the pleasure visits increased too. This can be related to economic situation 
#For instance if there was an increase in income of American-Taiwanise, both types of visits increase. The geographical distance may also be a cause that income fluctuations affect visiting patterns (it is more expensive to fly from the US to Taiwan)
